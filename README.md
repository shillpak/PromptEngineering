**Prompt engineering**

is the skill of crafting inputs (prompts) to get the most accurate, useful, or creative outputs from a language model (like ChatGPT). It's a blend of clear communication, structured formatting, and sometimes a bit of trickery or creativity.


**Core Concepts of Prompt Engineering**

**1. **What is a Prompt**?**


    A prompt is everything you give to the model to help it generate a response.
    Basic Example: “Write a short poem about the ocean.”
    The clearer and more detailed your prompt, the more precise the output.


**2. Types of Prompts**

Understanding different types helps you choose the best one for your task:
| Type | Description| Example |
| :------- | --------: | :------: |
| Instructional |Ask the model to perform a task |“Summarize this article in bullet points.”|
| Zero-shot |No examples, just a task.| “Translate this sentence to Spanish.”|
| Few-shot |Give a few examples to guide it. | “Here are 2 examples of emails, now write 1.”|
| Chain-of-thought |Ask the model to reason step by step. | “Solve this math problem and explain.”|
| Role-based |Give the model a role/persona. | “You’re a helpful tutor. Explain gravity.”|
| Formatting-based |Guide the structure of output. | “Return answer in JSON format.”|





**3. Basic Prompt Structure**

    A good prompt usually includes:
    * Task – What you want the model to do.
    * Context – Any relevant background.
    * Instructions – Specifics on style, format, or tone.

**4. The Importance of Clarity**

    Vague prompt:  “Tell me about dogs.”
    
    Better prompt: “Give me a 3-paragraph summary about Golden Retrievers, focusing on their behavior, training, and care needs.”

**5. Few-shot Prompting**

    Show examples to guide the model’s behavior.
    
    **Example:**
    
    Translate the following English phrases into French:
    * Hello – Bonjour
    * Good morning – Bonjour
    * How are you? – Comment ça va?
    * See you tomorrow
    
    The model will follow the pattern and complete it.

**6. Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

    Instruct the model to think step-by-step before answering.
    
    **Example:**
    
    “A train leaves at 3 PM and travels 60 km/h. How long will it take to travel 180 km? Explain your reasoning.”
    This encourages the model to break the problem down logically.

**7. Role Prompting**
    
    Assign the model a specific role to change its behavior.
    
    **Example:**
    
    “You are a certified nutritionist. Design a 7-day meal plan for a diabetic vegetarian.”
     The model will tailor its tone, language, and output to the role.

**8. Output Formatting**
    You can guide the AI to return answers in tables, code blocks, JSON, or bullet points.
    
    **Example:** 
    “Summarize this article in a bullet list of no more than 5 items.”
    
    **Or for developers:**
    “Respond with a JSON object containing title, summary, and keywords.”

**9. Prompt Iteration – The Secret Sauce**

      Rarely will you get the perfect result on the first try.
      Steps:
      1. Test the output.
      
      2. Identify what’s missing.
      
      3. Refine your prompt (clarify, add examples, reword).
      
      4. Repeat.
         This loop is what pros do. Prompting is part art, part science.

**10.  Tips for Effective Prompting**

      ✅ Be specific – Detail what you want.
      
      ✅ Use examples – Especially for creative tasks.
      
      ✅ Ask for reasoning – To improve accuracy.
      
      ✅ Limit scope – Break big tasks into small ones.
      
      ✅ Define constraints – Word count, tone, format.
      
      ✅ Test and refine – Always iterate.
